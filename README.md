Sentiment analysis of poetry pieces using Kmeans clustering algorithm

The data pipeline easiting of using NLP to preprocess the data and vectorize it using TF-IDF vectorizer and alternatively word2vec. The data was then trained on a K-means model and clustered into 3 groups. To visaulize the clusters, I used PCA dimensionality reduction.
